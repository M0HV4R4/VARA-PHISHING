# VARA-PHISHING

#Description
This project is a software tool that creates a professional fraudulent page that is an exact copy of Facebook and Instagram, so that it brings you the victim's login information. 

#The tool works as follows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Choose any page you want to work on (Instagram/Facebook).
2.Enter a direct link (the victim will be directed to the entered link so that he will never suspect).
3.The tool displays the victim's login information (username/password).
4.The tool directs the victim to the two-factor authentication page so that when you log in to the victim's account, he will give you the authentication.
4.After giving the victim the authentication, you can accept directing him to the link entered before.
